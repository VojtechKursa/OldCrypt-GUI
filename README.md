# OldCrypt
## Introduction
OldCrypt is an open-source program that performs encryption and decryption of data (either text or binary) using old encryption methods.
The main purpose of this program is entertainment (i.e. roleplay or just messing around with old cryptography) or education (introduction into cryptography).

## Important note
As this program is a simulator of old encryption methods, most of the methods in this program are by no means secure and shouldn't be used as such. Nowadays they can be cracked within seconds even on low-end phones.
In short, this program might encrypt your 18+ data against your parents, but will be just a good entertainment for people who actually want to dig in your private data.

## Using the program
To use this program you can either download a build from the [releases](https://github.com/VojtechKursa/OldCrypt-GUI/releases) section or build the program yourself using a C# compiler.
